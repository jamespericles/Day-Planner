PRIMARY GOALS

- When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed
<!-- - Scrolling down presents user with timeblocks for standard business hours -->
- Each timeblock is color coded to indicate past, present or future
  <!-- - When user clicks timeblock they can add an event -->
  <!-- - User is able to save event to timeblock (local storage) -->
  <!-- - Refreshing page reveals that text in timeblock persists -->

SECONDARY GOALS

- Display current time (XX:XX:XX)
- Have timeblock style change as time progresses (similar to loading bar where the color of the block fills from present to future as clock continues, probably too challenging given the time)
- Add button to edit or delete event besides adding
- Make user aware their edit has been saved
- Possibly link native calendar apps on users computer with the ability to write events created in website?
