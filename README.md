# Homework-05

For this week of homework, I was tasked with creating a planner application using jQuery. The planner must display the current date when opened, present the user with timebloks of standard business hours that are color coded based on whether they are in the past, present, or future. The user must be able to click into a timebloack and enter an event. Lastly, the user must have access to a save feature in order to save their events to local storage.
